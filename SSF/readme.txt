SSF (Search Spooled File) is a utility I wrote that lets me see only selected lines of a spooled file (report).

It consists of two source members:

SSF	the command source
SSFC	the CL command-processing program

I've also included two earlier versions of the utility for instructional purposes.

SSF1	the command which specifies search positions and search values in separate parameters.
SSF1C	the command processing program

SSF2	the command which specifies search positions and search values in mixed lists
SSF2C	the command processing program
